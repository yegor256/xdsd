<p>XDSD is an open software development methodology that aims
to reduce risks and improve quality in a project of almost any size.
At the moment, there are four fundamental principles:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Everyone gets paid for verified deliverables</li>
    <li>Defects are planned and don't block delivery</li>
    <li>Quality-of-code metrics are CI gate conditions</li>
    <li>Master branch is read-only</li>
</ul>
